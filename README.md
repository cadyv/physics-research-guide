## FAQ’s:
- *When is a good time to start physics research in undergrad?*

  There’s no right answer, but people generally say the earlier the better. Starting early gives you the most time and flexibility to explore physics research, and potentially the opportunity to try out multiple fields/projects/programs. In addition, some programs and funding are specifically earmarked for first-year students.
  
- *Should I be getting paid?*

  Absolutely! An exception is during the academic year, if you are counting your research as credit towards your degree. For summer opportunities, at the very least you should have a stipend that covers housing and living expenses. In some cases (for summer, or during the academic year), you can set it up so that being paid to do research qualifies as a work study job.

- *Who pays me?*
  
  There are a variety of options, but they can be broadly lumped into a few categories:
  1) A specific program (like an REU or other funded opportunity). These are most common for summer research experiences.
  2) A fellowship or grant. Many schools have internal fellowships specifically designed for funding undergraduate research, often designated for summer.
  3) The research group. When I've seen this option it's usually for a longer project (for instance, if you've been working in the same lab for multiple years).
